# NOTE, BUG
so basically i fucked up imports of the project images and imported from /public/projects/ instead of /projects/ (violating the idea that /public/ should be treated as identical to /)

so you need to either fix it or just copy the public folder in the build to make those photos appear.
this mistake extends to the logo which i imported from /src/components/ instead of /components

TODO
- [ ] fix whatever is written above
